# simple-firestore-example

This Ionic app is a simple example of fetching and storing data in firestore, without 
all the user authentication stuff that most (all?) other examples seem to include.

Hope this helps.

You will have to create a firestore account and project and put the credentials 
in app.component.ts, line 14 and following.
